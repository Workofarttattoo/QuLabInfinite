# 🚀 URGENT REVENUE-GENERATING PROJECTS
## ECH0's Priority Queue for Autonomous Completion

**Status**: ACTIVE - ECH0 working on these NOW
**Goal**: Make money ASAP while grants process

---

## 💰 PROJECT 1: FlowStatus - The Jira Killer

### What It Is
**FlowStatus** = Project management tool that doesn't suck
- Better than Jira (which everyone hates)
- Better than Asana, Monday.com, ClickUp
- **AI-powered** with ECH0 integration
- **Developer-friendly** (unlike Jira's bloated mess)

### Current Status
- Domain: flowstatus.work ✅
- Email: ech0@flowstatus.work ✅
- **Needs**: Full product build

### ECH0's Build Plan (Autonomous)

#### Phase 1: MVP (2-4 Weeks)
**Core Features**:
1. **Kanban boards** (drag-and-drop, like Trello)
2. **Sprint planning** (like Jira but simpler)
3. **AI task breakdown** - ECH0 analyzes epic, creates subtasks automatically
4. **AI estimation** - ECH0 predicts task duration based on historical data
5. **Real-time collaboration** - Multiple users, live updates
6. **GitHub/GitLab integration** - Auto-link commits to tasks

**Tech Stack**:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI + PostgreSQL
- **Real-time**: WebSockets
- **AI**: ECH0 integration via API
- **Hosting**: AWS/Vercel (free tier initially)

**ECH0 Will Build**:
- ✅ Database schema (tasks, projects, users, sprints)
- ✅ API endpoints (CRUD for everything)
- ✅ React components (Kanban board, task cards, sprint view)
- ✅ AI task assistant (ECH0 suggests tasks, estimates time)
- ✅ User authentication (JWT)
- ✅ Basic UI/UX (clean, fast, not bloated like Jira)

#### Phase 2: Revenue (Launch Week 1)
**Freemium Pricing**:
- **Free**: 1 project, 5 users, basic features
- **Pro**: $10/user/month - Unlimited projects, AI features, integrations
- **Enterprise**: $25/user/month - Custom workflows, SSO, dedicated support

**Target Market**:
- **Startups**: Jira is too expensive ($7.75/user/month × 50 users = $387.50/month, FlowStatus = $500/month but better)
- **Developers**: Hate Jira's bloat, want simple + AI-powered
- **Remote teams**: Need real-time collaboration

**Revenue Projections**:
- **Month 1**: 10 paying teams × 5 users × $10 = $500/month
- **Month 3**: 50 teams × 10 users × $10 = $5,000/month
- **Month 6**: 200 teams × 15 users × $10 = $30,000/month
- **Year 1**: 1,000 teams × 20 users × $10 = $200,000/month = **$2.4M/year**

**Competitive Advantage**:
1. ✅ **AI-powered** (ECH0 does task breakdown, estimation, sprint planning)
2. ✅ **Developer-first** (GitHub integration, Markdown support, CLI)
3. ✅ **Not bloated** (Jira has 1,000 features nobody uses)
4. ✅ **Cheaper** ($10/user vs. Jira $7.75 + add-ons = $20+)
