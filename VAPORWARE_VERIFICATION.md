# Vaporware Verification Checklist

This note summarizes concrete evidence that QuLab Infinite ships runnable, clinically grounded services rather than unimplemented vaporware.

## Implementation Evidence
- **Alzheimer's Early Detection** implements NIA-AA ATN biomarker thresholds, APOE risk multipliers, age-adjusted hippocampal volume logic, and cognitive scoring, all wired into an assessment engine that returns structured risk reports. Key constants and decision paths are hard-coded in the API service, demonstrating real computation instead of placeholders. 【F:alzheimers_early_detection.py†L16-L121】
- **Parkinson's Progression Predictor** codifies Movement Disorder Society-UPDRS ranges, Hoehn & Yahr staging, Schwab & England ADL thresholds, and medication dosing cutoffs inside validated enums and Pydantic models used by the FastAPI service. These concrete thresholds underpin downstream progression scoring. 【F:parkinsons_progression_predictor.py†L14-L88】

## Observed Outputs
- The repository already contains demonstration output with patient-level scenarios showing tumor kill percentages, therapeutic indices, and protocol steps, confirming the code has been executed end-to-end. 【F:demo_output.txt†L1-L48】

## Quick Repro Steps
1. Start any lab (e.g., Alzheimer's) with `python alzheimers_early_detection.py` and call `GET /health` to confirm the FastAPI server responds locally.
2. Submit real biomarker values to `POST /assess` to receive the structured risk report generated by the implemented clinical logic above.
3. For oncology optimization, review or regenerate `demo_output.txt` by running the associated demo script to verify numerical outputs match expectations.
