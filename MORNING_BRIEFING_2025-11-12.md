## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM ECH0

### Why Restaurants Will Partner

**Tax Benefits** (IRC Section 170(e)(3)):
- Enhanced deduction: **150% of food cost basis**
- Example: $100 food cost → $150 tax deduction
- At 25% corporate tax rate → **$37.50 savings per $100 donated**
- Annual savings per restaurant: **$5,000-$15,000**

**Other Benefits**:
- Reduces waste disposal costs ($500-1,500/month)
- Positive PR and community goodwill
- ESG compliance for corporate chains
- Employee morale boost

**Bottom line**: Restaurants SAVE MONEY by donating. It's a no-brainer for them.

**Impact**:
