## 2. Step-by-Step Lab Workflow

### Step 1: Preparation of Graphene Nanoplatelets Solution
**Time: 3 hours**

1. Add 50 mL of deionized water to a clean 100 mL beaker
2. Weigh out 100 g of graphene nanoplatelets using analytical balance
3. Add graphene to water slowly while stirring
4. Place beaker in ultrasonic bath
5. Sonicate for 3 hours at amplitude setting 40%
6. Monitor temperature: keep below 30°C (use ice bath if needed)
7. Target viscosity: ≤5 cP (measure with viscometer)

**Quality Check:**
- Visual: Uniform black suspension, no large aggregates
- Viscosity: 3-5 cP
- pH: 6.5-7.5

### Step 2: Airloy X103 Gel Preparation
**Time:** 4 hours (30 min active, 3.5 hours curing)

1. In a separate 5L flask, add 5 kg Airloy X103 precursor
2. Add 2.5 L deionized water
3. Stir gently with overhead stirrer at 200 RPM
4. Heat to 40°C on hot plate
5. Add 30 mL HCl 6M dropwise over 10 minutes
6. pH should reach 3.5-4.0
7. Continue stirring for 20 minutes
8. Allow to cure at room temperature for 3-4 hours

**Quality Check:**
- pH: 3.5-4.0
- Temperature during cure: 20-25°C
- Gel consistency: Firm but elastic

### Step 3: Graphene Integration
**Time:** 2 hours

1. Slowly add graphene suspension (from Step 1) to cured gel
2. Use high shear mixer at 5,000 RPM for 30 minutes
3. Monitor temperature: keep below 50°C
4. Add NaOH 1M solution dropwise to neutralize (target pH 7.0)
5. Continue mixing at 2,000 RPM for 1 hour
6. Final pH should be 6.8-7.2

**Quality Check:**
- Uniform distribution of graphene (visual inspection)
- pH: 6.8-7.2
- No phase separation
- Viscosity: 50-100 cP

### Step 4: Freeze Drying (Aerogel Formation)
**Time:** 48 hours

1. Pour mixture into freeze-dry trays (max 2 cm depth)
2. Place trays in freeze dryer
3. Freeze at -80°C for 4 hours
4. Start vacuum pump (target: <0.1 mbar)
5. Maintain -80°C for 24 hours (primary drying)
6. Slowly warm to -20°C over 12 hours (secondary drying)
7. Final drying at -10°C for 12 hours
8. Vent chamber slowly with dry nitrogen

**Quality Check:**
- Pressure: <0.1 mbar during drying
- Temperature profile followed correctly
- Visual: Monolithic structure, no cracks
- Mass loss: >95% (water removal)

### Step 5: Post-Processing
**Time:** 4 hours

1. Remove aerogel carefully from trays
2. Cut to desired dimensions with sharp blade
3. Condition at 60°C for 2 hours to remove residual moisture
4. Cool to room temperature in dessicator
5. Package in sealed aluminum foil bags with dessicant

**Quality Check:**
- Density: 0.05-0.10 g/cm³
- Surface area: >600 m²/g (BET measurement)
- Thermal conductivity: <0.015 W/(m·K)

## Notes and Recommendations

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Graphene Dispersion**: Most critical step - poor dispersion = poor performance
2. **pH Control**: Must be precise for gel formation
3. **Freeze Drying**: Cannot rush - condensation ruins product
4. **Moisture Control**: Package immediately after cooling

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Batch Size**: Can increase to 10 kg precursor with larger freeze dryer
2. **Graphene Loading**: Test 1.5-2.5 wt% for cost/performance trade-off
3. **Curing Time**: May reduce to 2 hours with heating (validate first)
4. **Freeze Drying**: Investigate spray freeze drying for faster cycles

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Cracking during freeze drying | Too fast temperature change | Slower ramp rates |
| Low surface area | Insufficient mixing | Longer mixing time |
| High density | Incomplete freeze drying | Extended secondary drying |
| Poor mechanical strength | Low graphene content | Increase to 2.5 wt% |
| Batch-to-batch variation | Raw material quality | Supplier qualification |
