## Executive Summary

Revolutionary food rescue system that partners with fast food restaurants, local eateries, and food businesses to rescue nightly waste food. We provide tax write-off documentation and pickup services in exchange for their end-of-day surplus food. Delivered to sober living centers, homeless shelters, and community centers.

**Business Model**: Social enterprise (501(c)(3) non-profit with earned revenue)
**Key Innovation**: Tax credit automation and food rescue logistics network
**Initial Launch**: 1 van, 3-5 partner restaurants, 1 sober living center or shelter
**Scalability**: Franchise model city-by-city

**Priority: HIGHEST - READY TO LAUNCH**

## The Breakthrough Model: Tax Credit Food Rescue Network

### Core Concept
Partner with fast food restaurants, pizza places, bakeries, delis, and local eateries that throw out food nightly. We provide:
1. **Nightly pickup service** (scheduled routes)
2. **Automated tax documentation** (donation receipts + value calculation)
3. **IRS-compliant reporting** (Form 8283 for non-cash charitable contributions)
4. **Impact reports** (pounds rescued, meals served, families fed)

In exchange, we get:
- Fresh surplus food (prepared meals, baked goods, produce)
- Partnership branding opportunities
- Their tax write-offs maximized (can deduct fair market value + 50% of appreciation under IRC Section 170(e)(3))

### Why Restaurants Will Partner

**Tax Benefits**:
- Enhanced deduction: Can deduct 150% of food cost basis (cost to produce)
- Example: $100 of food cost → $150 tax deduction
- At 25% corporate tax rate → $37.50 tax savings per $100 donated
- Annual savings for medium restaurant: $5,000-$15,000

**Other Benefits**:
- Reduces waste disposal costs ($500-1,500/month for dumpster service)
- Positive community PR and branding
- ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) compliance for corporate chains
- Employee morale boost (staff feel good about impact)
