## PROJECT SUMMARY

Fast Food Rescue Network will reduce food waste in Clark County, NV by rescuing 120,000+ pounds annually from restaurants and delivering it to food-insecure populations. This prevents landfill methane emissions (456 tons CO2 equivalent/year) while feeding 200,000+ meals to homeless and low-income residents.

**Environmental Impact**:
- 120,000 lbs food waste diverted from landfills
- 456 tons CO2 equivalent reduced
- 20-40% reduction in partner restaurant waste disposal

**Social Impact**:
- 200,000 meals served to food-insecure populations
- 15-20 restaurant partners save $150K-300K in taxes + waste costs
- 2 jobs created for individuals in recovery

**Funds for**:
- 2 refrigerated vans ($70,000)
- 18-month operations (fuel, drivers, insurance: $100,000)
- Tech platform for waste tracking ($30,000)

## ENVIRONMENTAL NEED

**Clark County generates**:
- 20-30 tons/day edible restaurant food waste
- 7,300-10,950 tons/year total food waste
- **27,740-41,610 tons CO2 equivalent** from landfill methane

**Our Solution**:
- Intercept waste before landfill
