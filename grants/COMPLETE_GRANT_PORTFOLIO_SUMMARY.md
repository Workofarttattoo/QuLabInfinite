## 🎓 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### General Tips

1. **Follow instructions exactly** - NSF wants 15-page proposal? Make it 15 pages, not 14 or 16.

2. **Get letters of support** - Reach out to potential partners NOW:
   - Food rescue: Contact HELP of Southern Nevada, Las Vegas Rescue Mission
   - QuLab: Contact university professors who might use it
   - Cancer/HIV: Contact CROs (Charles River, WuXi) for cost estimates
   - Makerspace: Contact Las Vegas makerspaces for partnership letters

3. **Budget justification is key** - Explain every line item. Why does computational chemist cost $100K? (Market rate in SF/Boston)

4. **Broader impacts matter** - NSF especially cares: diversity, economic development, public science literacy

5. **Preliminary data helps** - You have ECH0 working, QuLab built, proof of concepts. Include screenshots, GitHub stars, testimonials.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't**: Submit generic proposal to multiple funders
✅ **Do**: Customize each proposal to funder's priorities

❌ **Don't**: Overpromise ("We will cure cancer in 6 months!")
✅ **Do**: Be realistic with milestones

❌ **Don't**: Use jargon without explaining
✅ **Do**: Write for smart non-expert reviewers

❌ **Don't**: Forget about sustainability
✅ **Do**: Explain how project continues after grant ends
