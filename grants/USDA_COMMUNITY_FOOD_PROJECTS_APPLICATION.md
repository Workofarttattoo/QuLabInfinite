## NEED STATEMENT

### Clark County Food Insecurity Crisis

Clark County, Nevada faces severe food insecurity:
- **150,000 residents** are food insecure (15% of population)
- **45,000 individuals** experience homelessness annually
- **25,000 children** rely on school meal programs for nutrition
- **$2.50-3.50 average cost** per shelter meal strains nonprofit budgets

Meanwhile, Clark County restaurants discard an estimated:
- **20-30 tons of edible food daily** from fast food chains, bakeries, and delis
- **$15-25 million in annual food waste** (at retail value)
- **This waste generates 27,000-40,500 tons of CO2 annually** in landfills

**The disconnect**: Nutritious, safe food is discarded while neighbors go hungry.

### Existing Gaps in Food Rescue Infrastructure

Current food rescue efforts in Clark County are:
1. **Volunteer-dependent**: Unreliable schedules, inconsistent pickups
2. **Focused on grocery stores**: Missing fast food/restaurant sector
3. **Lacking tech infrastructure**: Manual processes, no tax automation
4. **Limited capacity**: Few organizations have refrigerated transport

**Fast Food Rescue Network solves these gaps** with professional, scheduled service and automated tax compliance.

## INNOVATION & TECHNOLOGY

### Tax Automation Platform

**Problem**: Restaurants struggle with IRS compliance for food donations
**Solution**: Our app automatically generates Form 8283 compliant documentation

**How it works**:
1. Driver scans QR code at restaurant pickup
2. App photos food items with AI volume estimation
3. System calculates fair market value (FDA databases + local prices)
4. Restaurant manager digitally signs donation receipt
5. Monthly reports auto-emailed with tax summary
6. Year-end Form 8283 generated for donations >$500

**Impact**: Restaurants save 5-10 hours/year on tax paperwork, increasing participation

### Real-Time Route Optimization

**Problem**: Static routes waste fuel and time when restaurant volumes vary
**Solution**: AI-powered dynamic routing based on predicted food volumes

**Algorithm**:
- Historical data: Past 90 days of pickup volumes per restaurant
- Day-of-week patterns: Monday vs. Friday volumes
- Holiday adjustments: More food before long weekends
- Real-time updates: Restaurant texts "extra food tonight"

**Impact**: 15-25% fuel savings, faster deliveries, happier partners

### Environmental Impact Dashboard

**Public-facing dashboard** (on website) shows:
- Pounds of food rescued (cumulative + monthly)
- Meals served
- CO2 equivalent saved (EPA conversion factors)
- Waste reduction by restaurant partner (leaderboard)

**Gamification**: Restaurants compete for "#1 Food Donor" badge, share on social media
