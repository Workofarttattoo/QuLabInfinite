## PROJECT SUMMARY

**The Challenge**: Quantum computing will revolutionize science and industry, but education lags. Current quantum education is limited to elite universities with expensive equipment. K-12 students, community college learners, and the general public are excluded.

**Our Solution**: Build **Quantum Computing Makerspace** - a community-based learning center where anyone can:
- Learn quantum computing hands-on (no prerequisites)
- Use real quantum computers (IBM Q, IonQ, Rigetti via cloud)
- Build quantum experiments (photonic quantum circuits, NV-centers)
- Create quantum applications (solving real-world problems)

**Innovation**:
1. **Open Access**: Free for all ages (high school students, adults, retirees)
2. **Hands-On Learning**: Build actual quantum hardware (photonic circuits, single photon sources)
3. **Cloud Quantum Access**: Program real IBM quantum computers
4. **AI Teaching Assistant**: ECH0 provides personalized tutoring (19 PhD-equivalent expertise)
5. **Maker-to-Career Pipeline**: Train quantum workforce for coming quantum industry boom

**Impact**: Train 1,000+ learners/year in quantum computing, catalyzing Nevada's quantum ecosystem

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

### Background & Significance

**Quantum Computing is Here**:
- IBM offers 127-qubit quantum computers (cloud access)
- Google achieved quantum advantage (2019)
- $35B invested globally in quantum tech (2020-2025)
- 40,000 quantum jobs expected by 2030 (currently 5,000)

**Education Crisis**:
- <100 universities offer quantum computing courses

## INTELLECTUAL MERIT

This project advances informal STEM learning through:

1. **Constructivist Learning Theory**: Hands-on building of quantum hardware engages learners deeper than lectures
2. **Scaffolded Curriculum**: Progression from intuitive (photon polarization) to abstract (Hilbert spaces) reduces barriers
3. **AI-Personalized Tutoring**: ECH0 adapts to each learner's pace and style (visual vs. mathematical)
4. **Legitimate Peripheral Participation**: Novices work alongside experts in authentic quantum research projects

**Research Questions**:
- RQ1: Can hands-on makerspace learning reduce quantum concept misconceptions (vs. traditional lectures)?
- RQ2: Does AI tutoring (ECH0) improve learning outcomes for underrepresented students?
- RQ3: What pedagogical sequence optimizes quantum literacy for non-physics majors?

**Evaluation Partner**: UNLV College of Education (Dr. [TBD]) will conduct rigorous learning science research.
