## THE PROBLEM

### Digital Divide in STEM Education

**Expensive Software Excludes Underserved Communities:**
- MATLAB: $2,350/year individual, $5,000+ institutional
- Mathematica: $1,895/year individual
- Specialized tools: $15,000-$50,000+/year

**Impact on Target Communities:**

**Las Vegas / Clark County:**
- 150,000+ residents food insecure (indicators of economic hardship)
- Limited access to advanced STEM tools in schools
- Underrepresented minorities lack tech education pathways
- Growing tech industry needs skilled workforce

**Santa Monica / Venice / West LA:**
- Gentrification pushing out underserved communities
- Digital literacy gap despite proximity to tech companies
- Youth in marginalized communities lack CS education exposure
- Google Venice office nearby but limited community engagement
