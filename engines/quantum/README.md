# Quantum Engines

This directory houses implementations for quantum benchmarks (e.g., VQE,
exact diagonalisation wrappers, device calibration layers). Follow the same
structure as the mechanics engines:

- Document the Hamiltonian construction and ansatz.
- Note simulator / hardware backend versions.
- Record domain of validity (basis sets, bond distances, noise models).
- Link to benchmark IDs defined in `bench/quantum`.

Populate with actual code once validated workflows are in place.
