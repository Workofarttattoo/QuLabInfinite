## 2026-02-23 - Missing Focus States in Custom Navigation
**Learning:** The custom button implementation for lab items completely lacks keyboard focus indicators, making navigation impossible for keyboard users. This is a critical pattern failure in this design system.
**Action:** Always verify custom interactive elements like `.lab-item` have explicit `:focus-visible` styles matching their hover states.

## 2026-02-23 - Duplicate ID issue
**Learning:** Having duplicate element IDs (`labSearch` was used twice in `index.html`) can cause the `getElementById` API to retrieve only the first match, resulting in bugs such as a secondary search bar not functioning properly. This violates basic HTML and accessibility rules regarding duplicate IDs.
**Action:** Always verify that input elements have unique IDs and ensure that event listeners are correctly assigned to each instance.

## 2026-05-19 - Screen Reader State Synchronization
**Learning:** Relying solely on visual active classes hides state from screen readers. Input fields that depend on placeholder text must also have an explicit aria-label.
**Action:** Synchronize visual active states with aria-current="true" and always add aria-label to inputs that lack visible labels.
