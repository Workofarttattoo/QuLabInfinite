# Calibration & Benchmark Reports

Save generated plots, markdown summaries, or notebooks from benchmark runs
here. For each benchmark ID, create a report file (e.g.,
`mech_304ss_tension_v1.md`) that records:

- data sources and preprocessing notes,
- calibration approach and priors,
- posterior parameter summaries / confidence intervals,
- acceptance metrics and whether gates passed,
- known caveats or TODOs.

Reports should be human-readable and reference the provenance ID stored in the
canonical dataset.
