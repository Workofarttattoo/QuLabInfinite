================================================================================


## ANALYSIS 1: FUNCTION CARTOGRAPHY

### Question: What can we do?

**Total Capabilities**: 24

### Core Functions:

- Dynamic Expert Loading (load 14-20B, access 56B-322B total)

- Intelligent Query Routing (keyword-based expert selection)

- Prompt Compression (50-80% token reduction)

- RAG Context Retrieval (past solution reuse)

- Ensemble Mode (query multiple experts)

- Automatic Expert Swapping (memory management)


## ANALYSIS 2: SEMANTIC LATTICE

### Question: How does it structure?

**Architectural Layers**: 6

### Data Flow:

`User Query → RAG Retrieval → Compression → Routing → Loading → Execution → Learning → Response`


## ANALYSIS 3: ECHO VISION

### Question: What patterns emerge?

**Emergent Behaviors**: 4

### Key Patterns:

- **Adaptive Memory Management**: System automatically swaps experts to maintain constant 14-20B footprint

- **Self-Improving RAG**: Knowledge base grows with each query, improving future retrievals

- **Compression-Routing Synergy**: Compressed prompts make routing more accurate (less noise)

- **Ensemble Wisdom**: Multiple experts provide diverse perspectives on complex problems


## ANALYSIS 4: PREDICTION ORACLE

### Question: What futures are possible?

**Near-Term Enhancements**: 3

### Top Predictions:

- **Add 19 more domain experts → 322B total capacity** (95% probability)

  - Timeline: 1-2 weeks

  - Impact: 16.1x memory efficiency, comprehensive domain coverage

- **Vector DB upgrade (ChromaDB/FAISS)** (85% probability)

  - Timeline: 1 week

  - Impact: Scalable RAG to millions of entries

- **Fine-tune experts on specialized datasets** (90% probability)

  - Timeline: 2-4 weeks

  - Impact: Higher quality domain-specific responses
