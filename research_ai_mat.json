      "title": "Artificial Intelligence and Generative Models for Materials Discovery --\n  A Review",
      "authors": "Albertus Denny Handoko, Riko I Made",
      "published": "2025-08-05T09:56:27Z",
      "summary": "High throughput experimentation tools, machine learning (ML) methods, and\nopen material databases are radically changing the way new materials are\ndiscovered. From the experimentally driven approach in the past, we are moving\nquickly towards the artificial intelligence (AI) driven approach, realizing the\n'inverse design' capabilities that allow the discovery of new materials given\nthe desired properties. This review aims to discuss different principles of\nAI-driven generative models that are applicable for materials discovery,\nincluding different materials representations available for this purpose. We\nwill also highlight specific applications of generative models in designing new\ncatalysts, semiconductors, polymers, or crystals while addressing challenges\nsuch as data scarcity, computational cost, interpretability, synthesizability,\nand dataset biases. Emerging approaches to overcome limitations and integrate\nAI with experimental workflows will be discussed, including multimodal models,\nphysics informed architectures, and closed-loop discovery systems. This review\naims to provide insights for researchers aiming to harness AI's transformative\npotential in accelerating materials discovery for sustainability, healthcare,\nand energy innovation.",

      "authors": "Shengchao Liu, Hannan Xu, Yan Ai, Huanxin Li, Yoshua Bengio, Harry Guo",
      "published": "2025-07-21T23:46:11Z",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) techniques to\ntackle complex problems, representing a transformative breakthrough in\nartificial intelligence (AI). However, their reasoning capabilities have\nprimarily been demonstrated in solving math and coding problems, leaving their\npotential for domain-specific applications-such as battery discovery-largely\nunexplored. Inspired by the idea that reasoning mirrors a form of guided\nsearch, we introduce ChatBattery, a novel agentic framework that integrates\ndomain knowledge to steer LLMs toward more effective reasoning in materials\ndesign. Using ChatBattery, we successfully identify, synthesize, and\ncharacterize three novel lithium-ion battery cathode materials, which achieve\npractical capacity improvements of 28.8%, 25.2%, and 18.5%, respectively, over\nthe widely used cathode material, LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811). Beyond this\ndiscovery, ChatBattery paves a new path by showing a successful LLM-driven and\nreasoning-based platform for battery materials invention. This complete\nAI-driven cycle-from design to synthesis to characterization-demonstrates the\ntransformative potential of AI-driven reasoning in revolutionizing materials\ndiscovery.",

      "published": "2025-04-17T21:26:48Z",
      "summary": "AI-powered autonomous experimentation (AI/AE) can accelerate materials\ndiscovery but its effectiveness for electronic materials is hindered by data\nscarcity from lengthy and complex design-fabricate-test-analyze cycles. Unlike\nexperienced human scientists, even advanced AI algorithms in AI/AE lack the\nadaptability to make informative real-time decisions with limited datasets.\nHere, we address this challenge by developing and implementing an AI decision\ninterface on our AI/AE system. The central element of the interface is an AI\nadvisor that performs real-time progress monitoring, data analysis, and\ninteractive human-AI collaboration for actively adapting to experiments in\ndifferent stages and types. We applied this platform to an emerging type of\nelectronic materials-mixed ion-electron conducting polymers (MIECPs) -- to\nengineer and study the relationships between multiscale morphology and\nproperties. Using organic electrochemical transistors (OECT) as the testing-bed\ndevice for evaluating the mixed-conducting figure-of-merit -- the product of\ncharge-carrier mobility and the volumetric capacitance ({\\mu}C*), our adaptive\nAI/AE platform achieved a 150% increase in {\\mu}C* compared to the commonly\nused spin-coating method, reaching 1,275 F cm-1 V-1 s-1 in just 64 autonomous\nexperimental trials. A study of 10 statistically selected samples identifies\ntwo key structural factors for achieving higher volumetric capacitance: larger\ncrystalline lamellar spacing and higher specific surface area, while also\nuncovering a new polymer polymorph in this material.",

      "published": "2023-11-18T12:35:45Z",
      "summary": "Many environmental remediation and energy applications (conversion and\nstorage) for sustainability need design and development of green novel\nmaterials. Discovery processes of such novel materials are time taking and\ncumbersome due to large number of possible combinations and permutations of\nmaterials structures. Often theoretical studies based on Density Functional\nTheory (DFT) and other theories, coupled with Simulations are conducted to\nnarrow down sample space of candidate materials, before conducting\nlaboratory-based synthesis and analytical process. With the emergence of\nartificial intelligence (AI), AI techniques are being tried in this process too\nto ease out simulation time and cost. However tremendous values of previously\npublished research from various parts of the world are still left as\nlabor-intensive manual effort and discretion of individual researcher and prone\nto human omissions. AIMS-EREA is our novel framework to blend best of breed of\nMaterial Science theory with power of Generative AI to give best impact and\nsmooth and quickest discovery of material for sustainability. This also helps\nto eliminate the possibility of production of hazardous residues and\nbye-products of the reactions. AIMS-EREA uses all available resources --\nPredictive and Analytical AI on large collection of chemical databases along\nwith automated intelligent assimilation of deep materials knowledge from\npreviously published research works through Generative AI. We demonstrate use\nof our own novel framework with an example, how this framework can be\nsuccessfully applied to achieve desired success in development of\nthermoelectric material for waste heat conversion.",
