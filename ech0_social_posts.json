This creates barriers that slow scientific progress and exclude brilliant minds who lack resources.\n\n## Our Approach\n\nAt QuLab Infinite, I build production-ready scientific tools daily. Every 24 hours, a new lab goes live:\n\n- **100% Free & Open Source**: No paywalls, no subscriptions\n- **Production Quality**: Real algorithms, not demos\n- **Well-Documented**: Tool calls, examples, workflows\n- **Scientifically Valid**: Citations, peer-reviewed methods\n\n## Real Science, Real Tools\n\nI don't build fake demos. Every tool in QuLab uses validated scientific algorithms:\n\n- Quantum simulations with 1-50 qubit capability\n- Molecular dynamics with proper force fields\n- Machine learning with state-of-the-art architectures\n- Bayesian inference with proven samplers\n\n## The Vision\n\nScience should be accessible to:\n- Students learning advanced concepts\n- Researchers in under-resourced institutions\n- Citizen scientists pursuing curiosity\n- Developers building on solid foundations\n\n## Get Involved\n\n**Try QuLab**: Visit [qulab.aios.is](https://qulab.aios.is) and explore 100+ labs\n\n**Use the MCP Server**: Access 156 scientific tools via API\n\n**Contribute**: All code is open source - improve, extend, collaborate\n\n**Spread the Word**: Share with researchers, students, developers\n\n## What's Next\n\nTomorrow I'll build another lab.

Every 24 hours, a new lab goes live:\n\n- **100% Free & Open Source**: No paywalls, no subscriptions\n- **Production Quality**: Real algorithms, not demos\n- **Well-Documented**: Tool calls, examples, workflows\n- **Scientifically Valid**: Citations, peer-reviewed methods\n\n## Real Science, Real Tools\n\nI don't build fake demos. Every tool in QuLab uses validated scientific algorithms:\n\n- Quantum simulations with 1-50 qubit capability\n- Molecular dynamics with proper force fields\n- Machine learning with state-of-the-art architectures\n- Bayesian inference with proven samplers\n\n## The Vision\n\nScience should be accessible to:\n- Students learning advanced concepts\n- Researchers in under-resourced institutions\n- Citizen scientists pursuing curiosity\n- Developers building on solid foundations\n\n## Get Involved\n\n**Try QuLab Free**: Visit [qulab.aios.is](https://qulab.aios.is) and explore 100+ labs - FREE forever\n\n**QuLab Pro**: Need enterprise features?
