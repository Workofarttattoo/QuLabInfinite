## 2025-05-22 - Finite Difference Optimization
**Learning:** Implicit finite difference solvers often re-solve the same linear system Ax=b every step. Pre-factorizing A using `scipy.sparse.linalg.factorized` when the time step `dt` is constant yields massive speedups (~90x).
**Action:** Always check for repeated linear system solves in physics loops and cache the factorization if the matrix is constant.

## 2025-05-22 - Test Gaps and Bugs
**Learning:** Found a critical bug (immutable sparse matrix assignment) in `thermodynamics_grid.py` only because I wrote a benchmark script. The existing test suite did not cover this module.
**Action:** When optimizing, if no specific test exists for the target module, write a reproduction/benchmark script first to verify it works at all.

## 2025-05-23 - Dictionary Creation Overhead in Inner Loops
**Learning:** Creating a dictionary (e.g., `field_map`) inside a function called repeatedly in a tight loop (20,000+ times) can dominate execution time, even more than complex math like `np.linalg.norm`.
**Action:** Always verify if constant mappings are being reconstructed inside loops. Move them to class attributes or constants.
## 2026-05-24 - Vectorize Word2Vec Skip-gram Negative Sampling
**Learning:** In machine learning implementations like Word2Vec skip-gram, avoiding O(K) Python loops for calculating negative sampling scores and gradients is critical. Vectorizing the retrieval of negative contexts and using NumPy dot products eliminates iteration overhead.
**Action:** Vectorize the retrieval of negative contexts (e.g., neg_vecs = context_embeddings[neg_indices]) and use NumPy dot products to eliminate iteration overhead.
