## 2025-05-22 - Finite Difference Optimization
**Learning:** Implicit finite difference solvers often re-solve the same linear system Ax=b every step. Pre-factorizing A using `scipy.sparse.linalg.factorized` when the time step `dt` is constant yields massive speedups (~90x).
**Action:** Always check for repeated linear system solves in physics loops and cache the factorization if the matrix is constant.

## 2025-05-22 - Test Gaps and Bugs
**Learning:** Found a critical bug (immutable sparse matrix assignment) in `thermodynamics_grid.py` only because I wrote a benchmark script. The existing test suite did not cover this module.
**Action:** When optimizing, if no specific test exists for the target module, write a reproduction/benchmark script first to verify it works at all.

## 2025-05-23 - Dictionary Creation Overhead in Inner Loops
**Learning:** Creating a dictionary (e.g., `field_map`) inside a function called repeatedly in a tight loop (20,000+ times) can dominate execution time, even more than complex math like `np.linalg.norm`.
**Action:** Always verify if constant mappings are being reconstructed inside loops. Move them to class attributes or constants.

## 2025-05-24 - TumorSimulator Dictionary and Distance Loop Overhead
**Learning:** Instantiating dictionaries dynamically and running `np.linalg.norm` loops inside heavily repeated 3D simulation loops causes massive overhead. Profiling showed 5 steps of 5,000 cells taking ~2.5s.
**Action:** Replaced dynamic dictionaries with class-level attributes (`_FIELD_MAP`) and refactored N*M distance calculations to use single vectorized broadcasting operations before the loop, cutting execution time to ~1.4s.
