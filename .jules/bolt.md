## 2025-05-22 - Finite Difference Optimization
**Learning:** Implicit finite difference solvers often re-solve the same linear system Ax=b every step. Pre-factorizing A using `scipy.sparse.linalg.factorized` when the time step `dt` is constant yields massive speedups (~90x).
**Action:** Always check for repeated linear system solves in physics loops and cache the factorization if the matrix is constant.

## 2025-05-22 - Test Gaps and Bugs
**Learning:** Found a critical bug (immutable sparse matrix assignment) in `thermodynamics_grid.py` only because I wrote a benchmark script. The existing test suite did not cover this module.
**Action:** When optimizing, if no specific test exists for the target module, write a reproduction/benchmark script first to verify it works at all.

## 2025-05-23 - Dictionary Creation Overhead in Inner Loops
**Learning:** Creating a dictionary (e.g., `field_map`) inside a function called repeatedly in a tight loop (20,000+ times) can dominate execution time, even more than complex math like `np.linalg.norm`.
**Action:** Always verify if constant mappings are being reconstructed inside loops. Move them to class attributes or constants.
## 2025-05-23 - Massive Dynamic Object Allocation Overhead in NLP Layer
**Learning:** In the NLP `EmbeddingLayer`, dynamically generating large uniform arrays (e.g. `np.random.uniform(low=-1.0, high=1.0, size=(10000, 50))`) repeatedly on every `forward` pass creates a monumental memory and execution overhead, especially inside high-iteration loops like text embeddings. Generating these constants iteratively takes >95% of processing time.
**Action:** Always verify that constant matrices (like random embeddings or pre-computed lookup tables) are constructed exactly once in the class `__init__` rather than dynamically during `forward` or `update` passes.

## 2024-05-18 - Replacing Lists with Deques for Graph Theory Queues
**Learning:** Found graph algorithms using `queue.pop(0)` for Breadth-First Searches and shortest path findings on lists. This forces an O(N) memory shift for every element removed from the queue, causing a significant performance bottleneck, particularly for large graphs where queue size can grow quite large. We also pre-computed neighbors when getting all shortest paths.
**Action:** Replace `queue = []` with `queue = deque()` and `queue.pop(0)` with `queue.popleft()` from the `collections` module. Also replace O(N) `get_neighbors()` calls inside loops with vectorized numpy logic like `np.where(adjacency_matrix[node])[0].tolist()`.
