## 2025-05-22 - Finite Difference Optimization
**Learning:** Implicit finite difference solvers often re-solve the same linear system Ax=b every step. Pre-factorizing A using `scipy.sparse.linalg.factorized` when the time step `dt` is constant yields massive speedups (~90x).
**Action:** Always check for repeated linear system solves in physics loops and cache the factorization if the matrix is constant.

## 2025-05-22 - Test Gaps and Bugs
**Learning:** Found a critical bug (immutable sparse matrix assignment) in `thermodynamics_grid.py` only because I wrote a benchmark script. The existing test suite did not cover this module.
**Action:** When optimizing, if no specific test exists for the target module, write a reproduction/benchmark script first to verify it works at all.

## 2025-05-23 - Dictionary Creation Overhead in Inner Loops
**Learning:** Creating a dictionary (e.g., `field_map`) inside a function called repeatedly in a tight loop (20,000+ times) can dominate execution time, even more than complex math like `np.linalg.norm`.
**Action:** Always verify if constant mappings are being reconstructed inside loops. Move them to class attributes or constants.
## 2025-05-18 - Avoid Python loop overhead with vectorized NumPy random generation
**Learning:** In large scale simulations, calling np.random.randint within a Python loop creates massive overhead compared to pre-allocating random values using size=N.
**Action:** Always vectorize the generation of random indices using NumPy arrays and avoid repeatedly calling min/max in hot loops.
